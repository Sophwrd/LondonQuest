# The London Quest
Welcome to the London Quest! Come discover the big city of London where the player visits a friend who's there for an exchange. Through this trip, the player encounters different obstacles and if they choose the correct words, they can gather souvenirs and tools to help them through their journey.

## Description
The London Quest is an interactive fiction game made with [Twine](https://twinery.org/) where the player discovers the city of London, England. In this game, the player interacts with diverse characters and is confronted with English grammar and vocabulary. The English level is designed to be at a B2 level (intermediate level).

The game includes grammar and vocabulary choices where the choice of the player is either correct or false, but it also includes choices that do not have a correct answer and instead allow the player to receive objects and gifts which could help them on their journey throughout London.
